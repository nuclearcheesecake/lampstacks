Working with back-end technology often requires a programmer to find ways to help servers talk to websites, while wrangling data that could provide insight to companies. A LAMP stack is a configuration of different technologies that simplifies this process, allowing data to flow from databases onto webpages, with scripting power to manipulate outputs. To create a LAMP stack, you would need some variation of the following:

- L - A Linux distribution, to run everything on
- A - Apache HTTP web server, to speak to the web
- M - MySQL/MSSQL/Some other database, to store relevant information
- P - PHP/Python, to create useful scripts to work with the data and websites

Here is a helpful visual from [this](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/what-is-a-lamp-stack/) website, which also provides some further reading. The image is rather helpful to understand the architecture used to create a LAMP stack, and how it all fits together:

</p>

So, to implement my own LAMPs, I chose two different approaches. I have worked with Oracle databases and PL/SQL extensively during my studies, thus I branched out to use two types of databases I previously only dabbled in. I also used this chance to work with two new Linux distributions. The LAMPs I built thus used:
- MySQL, implemented on Ubuntu
- Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), implemented on CentOS

Let's start stacking, then!

# 1. Ubuntu 20.04 / MySQL LAMP

## 1.1 List of installed packages

For Ubuntu, outside of all of the dependencies and the pre-installed Ubuntu packages, these are the ones I installed to work with the LAMP:
- apache2
- mysql-server
- php
- libapache2-mod-php
- php-mysql

This is fortunately a rather all-encompassing suite that allowed me to complete all of the following steps. To see how to install and configure these packages, see [here](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-install-and-configure-php-for-apache-and-mysql-wb1m33z1), but it boils down to:

```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
```

## 1.2 Getting Apache to work

To set up our web server, run the following commands

```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

You should then see the following:

<p align="center">

</p>

This means that your web server is running. Great! We can see the default Apache page in-browser then, by typing "http://" + your server's local IP, or just "localhost/". It should display like this:

<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="https://github.com/nuclearcheesecake/lampstacks/blob/main/images/image%20(13).png">
</p>

We can use Apache's Root Directory to include files that will become other pages on this server. Usually, this directory is /var/www/html/ - any files in here will be processed as part of the web server.

## 1.3 Building the database

Now we can work with our data. For this exercise, I have created a database (called "rftest") with the following structure:

Tables:
- Sale (sale_ID, prod_ID, sm_ID, sale_quantity, sale_total)
- Salesman (sm_ID, sm_fullname, sm_commission)
- Product (prod_ID, prod_name, prod_price, prod_stock)

I also create two triggers:
- updatestock, so that when a sale is made, the appropriate amount of inventory is deducted from a product's stock in the Product table
- updatecommission, that increments a salesman's commission by 5% of the sale total

We can see the results below. Firstly, we must start and enable MySQL:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl enable mysql
```

We can then look at what is stored inside of the databse:

</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="https://github.com/nuclearcheesecake/lampstacks/blob/main/images/image%20(17).png">
</p>

We can also observe that when a sale is made, the triggers fire:

## 1.4 PHP scripting

Now that we have data, we need some way to display it on our Apache web server. Firsly, we can create a script as follows to display information on the PHP we are using on this system:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/html/info.php
```

Inside of this file, we put:

```php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

If we then head over to our webpage, and append the name of the file (thus search for "localhost/info.php") we see the following:

<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="https://github.com/nuclearcheesecake/lampstacks/blob/main/images/image%20(14).png">
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="https://github.com/nuclearcheesecake/lampstacks/blob/main/images/image%20(15).png">
</p>

This is, however useful to the programmer to see, not much to look at for a general use. I have thus written the following script to add more valuable information to the server:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/html/test.php

```

Inside of this file:

```php
<?php

$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "SQl777@@@", "rftest");

if($conn->connect_error) {
	die("ERROR - cannot connect: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

echo 'Connected to database.<br>';

$result = $conn->query("SELECT sm_fullname FROM salesman");

echo "<br>Number of salesmen: $result->num_rows<br>";

$result = $conn->query("SELECT prod_id FROM product");

echo "Number of products: $result->num_rows<br>";

$result = $conn->query("SELECT sale_id FROM sale");

echo "Number of sales: $result->num_rows<br>";

$result = $conn->query("SELECT * FROM salesman WHERE (sm_commission) IN (SELECT MAX(sm_commission) from salesman)");

echo "<br>Top-selling salesman with commission:<br>";

if ($result->num_rows > 0) {
	while($row = $result->fetch_assoc() ){
		echo $row["sm_fullname"] ." earning Â£" .$row["sm_commission"];
	}
}

$result->close();

$conn->close();

?>
```

When we thus go to "localhost/test.php", we can see the result:

<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="https://github.com/nuclearcheesecake/lampstacks/blob/main/images/image%20(18).png">
</p>

Note that here, only one sale is recorded. If we however add the sale made above (Josh's rubber wheelchair) we see the counter update:

<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="https://github.com/nuclearcheesecake/lampstacks/blob/main/images/image%20(21).png">
</p>

We can also make a few large sales to push up the commission in order to change the top-selling salesperson:

## 2.1 List of installed packages and getting Apache to work

The process is mostly the same as for Ubuntu, but there are certain packages that would be different, as well as the process of installing them. The main packages would be:
- httpd
- SEARCH HOW YOU INSTALLED MSSQL

In the end, you want to run the following:

```bash
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

And then see, as above, that the server is running and displaying:

## 2.2 Building the database

The database is the same as above.

The triggers were created as:

- updatestock
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.updatestock ON dbo.sale FOR INSERT
AS
declare @prod_ID int;
declare @sale_quantity FLOAT (20);

select @prod_ID=i.prod_ID from inserted i;
select @sale_quantity=i.sale_quantity from inserted i;

UPDATE dbo.product
SET prod_stock = (SELECT prod_stock from dbo.product where prod_ID = @prod_id) - @sale_quantity
WHERE prod_ID = @prod_ID;
```

- updatecommission
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER dbo.updatecommission ON dbo.sale FOR INSERT
AS
declare @sm_ID int;
declare @sale_total FLOAT (20);

select @sm_IDint=i.sm_IDint from inserted i;
select @sale_total=i.sale_total from inserted i;

UPDATE dbo.salesman
SET sm_commission = (SELECT sm_commission from dbo.salesman where sm_ID= @sm_ID) + 0.05*@sale_total
WHERE sm_ID = @sm_ID;
```
