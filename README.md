Here is a helpful visual from [this](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/what-is-a-lamp-stack/) website, which also provides some further reading. It is rather helpful to understand the architecture used to create a LAMP stack.

So, to implement my own LAMPs, I chose two different approaches. I have worked with Oracle database and PL/SQL extensively during my studies, thus I branched out to use two types of databases I previously only dabbled in. I also used this chance to work with Linux distributions I have not had much experience with. The two LAMPs I built thus used:
- MySQL, implemented on Ubuntu
- Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), implemented on CentOS
